## Make It Work

1. Make it Work.
2. Make it Right.
3. Make it Fast.

I was catching up with my work friend Shawn, who has a background in web development and completed a coding bootcamp, about my progress with this development work I'm doing. It's so good to have someone who's roughly at my level of learning development, whose experience I feel like I can understand and who can understand my struggles with learning. I'm in this gray area between functional competency with the language and individual technologies, but lacking experience and cohesive tutorials or direction on assembling those into the larger systems I want. I can do all the simplistic blog/Q&A site/game tutorials, but I want the next thing beyond that. So many people I talk to who seem to be beyond that level are then experienced by years in this stuff, and they talk in ways that feels obtuse and inaccessible. It's just really nice to have a powerful realization like "Oh, Express is all middleware!" and to really get middleware, and to hear someone else have the same realization. So I'm on the right track! Phew.

Shawn mentioned the priority list that's at the beginning of this post, which he said he'd heard from someone else and it really stuck with him. It made me realize I've been trying to skip out on the hard work of #1 and jumping into #2, trying to make it right. But a well-designed non-functional system is just such wasted effort. That's like building a car from scratch and assembling the body before I get the engine running. 

The work of getting the engine running when I have gotten very few engines running before, and this feels like an entirely different kind of engine than I've ever assembled before, is so messy and non-linear and full of repeated failures and baffling errors, which I have no choice but to persevere through until it does just work and it clicks. There's hardly any warning when that happens. I just have to keep trying and not give up when I don't understand or I'm not sure what to do next.

I'm building this real-time web chat app for a class taking place in early May, where corporate executives are students and will be using the system to capture their discussion in a negotiation exercise. The text of their conversations needs to be stored in a database, and packaged up after the exercise completes and sent to a researcher at another University who will do linguistic analysis on the text to provide feedback to the students to negotiate more effectively.

So I wanted to build this app with an admin interface to create class sessions, then create chat groups/channels associated with each class session, and to be able to view and name the participants per chat group and view the current and past messages of any given chat. I wanted to be able to have the admin passively and invisibly observe the discourse of a given chat in real-time. I wanted to give the admin a way to access and distribute the unique login-less URLs per participant. 

And then I realized that's really not the core of "Make it Work". The core of that is get the real-time chat working with the unique login-less URL, with message storage in the database, working just once. All I have right now is the real-time chat working, I have the theoretical constructions of working with the database, but I don't have them joined. I don't have the login-less unique URL per user. I don't have the limitation of two participants per chat. I don't know how to do those, and that's precisely what I need to focus on.

It reminds me of this quotation from TeamTreehouse's How To Learn course (which I talked about in [my previous post](https://lovingawareness.github.io/growth-mindset/)), by instructor Dave McFarland:

> I learned a long time ago that I have to be okay with not immediately being an expert. But the way I've taught myself to get better at learning is identifying what I don't understand and working on it bit by bit until I do. It takes time and it isn't always fun, but it's always rewarding knowing you've put in the time and learned something you thought was too complicated for you.

Today, and every day hereafter in my work as a developer, I will live in the space of things I thought were too complicated for me. Focus on that thing I don't understand and erode my blocks to understanding until the awareness reveals itself in stunning clarity. It's just a matter of persistence, committing to making a lot of mistakes and finding my way out of them, and time.
