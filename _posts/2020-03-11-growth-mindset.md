I'm starting this blog to keep track of my progress in learning skills as a web developer, having started in that position professionally at Kellogg School of Management in the start of 2020. I was previously a developer at several companies but didn't have the imperative to learn on my own in quite the way I do now. I'm using languages and technologies not used by the rest of the development group here, and they're languages and technologies that are new to me as well, but I feel they're worthwhile investments for me. The process of deliberately learning something new, and sticking with it, on a timetable (I have a project due in the next month) is particularly new, and so it requires deliberate practice.

I'm realizing I have had a fixed mindset for a long time, from being a child "good at math" and I'm having to shrug off the habits of the fixed mindset and adopt the healthy habits of the growth mindset.

Last week, I realized I really needed more help with developing this app, in particular with learning about using JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, Vue.js, MongoDB, CSS, Docker, and application architecture, and I wasn't getting it quickly enough using the awesome track at [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). I signed up for [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), which I'd used five years ago, with great success, to learn about WordPress and PHP programming when I worked as a News Apps Developer at Hoy Chicago. 

Today, I'm realizing that I really need to take a step back from the nitty gritty of the languages and think about the overall architecture of my solution. I'm seeing that there are going to be several parts that are best built separately - the MongoDB database server, the RESTful API server that interfaces between the MongoDB server and the admin interface, the admin frontend interface to administer chat sessions, a server that interfaces between the MongoDB server and the chat frontend using Socket.io, and the actual frontend interface of the chat interface. I need more skills to be able to even describe that well, and then break that down into actionable steps. I'm not really sure what to call that, and how to find resources I can learn that quick and dirty in a day or two.

I happened upon this [How To Learn](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-learn) workshop at Team Treehouse, which has been super helpful in teasing out my lurking fixed mindset automatic thoughts, and has given me so much to do differently. I know I've been avoidant of the discomfort of not being an expert and of not getting things instantly, and this training normalizes that experience. I feel so relieved to find this recognition of my experience and that I just need to keep going. It gives me tools for preparing myself to be in the best mindset to approach this kind of learning. Here are some of the key nuggets I got:

## Instructor Dave McFarland said these:

"The one thing I don't do is just give up. Learning is challenging and learning something like computer programming, data analysis, or some other technical skill takes time."

"You'll rarely just get it."

"Sometimes you'll need to live with the slight discomfort of not totally understanding everything you learn."

### "Often, when we're struggling the most, we're learning the most, even if it doesn't feel like it at the time."

"I learned a long time ago that I have to be okay with not immediately being an expert. But the way I've taught myself to get better at learning is identifying what I don't understand and working on it bit by bit until I do."

### "It takes time and it isn't always fun, but it's always rewarding knowing you've put in the time and learned something that you thought was too complicated for you."

In a study, people who were praised for effort pushed themselves to try the more challenging of two tasks offered to them.

"A growth mindset likes challenges and accepts failure as just one step along the learning path."

"While it might sound like a big compliment to be called a math whiz or a programming genius, it's been proven to actually limit a person's potential to grow and achieve. Just as labels like "stupid" or phrases like "I guess I'm just not the programming type" keep people from pushing themselves to learn and grow."

He suggested taking the following phrases common to a fixed mindset and replace them with new ones that align with the growth mindset:

Old/Fixed: I'm no good at this.
New/Growth: How can I improve?

Old/Fixed: I give up.
New/Growth: Let me try a different way.

Old/Fixed: I failed.
New/Growth: Mistakes are a part of learning.

Old/Fixed: This is too hard.
New/Growth: Learning just takes time.


Yesterday, I finished the [Build a REST API With Express](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-rest-api-with-express) course and have a much better idea of how to build a REST API in Node.JS/Express. I don't want to actually create it yet, though, until I have a better idea of where it fits into the overall architecture and make sure I'm building it correctly the first time so I won't be distracted by having to go back to fix it later (still very possible).
